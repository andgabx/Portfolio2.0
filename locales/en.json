While hardware is cool, my passion has always leaned towards software, especially front-end development. There's something about seeing a beautifully crafted, responsive website that always caught my eye and made me want to create my own. Right now, I'm working on a really fun solo project, I'm trying to rebuild a School Management System. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on the mat practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, getting lost in a good book, or hanging out with friends.",
